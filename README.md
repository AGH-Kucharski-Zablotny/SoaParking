How to setup wildfly:
1. Extract WildflyConfiguration.zip to wildfly directory (it should be at the same level as standalone, bin, docs etc)
2. Enter extracted directory
3. Run './ParkingSystemSetup.sh <database_username (and database name as well)> <database password>' from terminal
4. Run project and hope it works :)
